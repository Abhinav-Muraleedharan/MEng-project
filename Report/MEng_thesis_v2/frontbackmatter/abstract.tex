In this work, we present Retention, a novel autoregressive model for generative modelling of sequences. Unlike Transformer based autoregressive models, retention scales linearly with respect to context size. We apply retention based models for modelling neural dynamics and achieve SOTA performance in neural modelling and behaviour decoding.
